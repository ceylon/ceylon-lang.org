# Frequently Asked Questions

We have specialized FAQs for certain important subjects:

* [Language design FAQ](language-design)
* [IDE FAQ](ide)

On this page you'll find answers to a few of the most 
common questions about the Ceylon project.  

#{page.table_of_contents}

## Basics

### What is Ceylon?

Ceylon is a new language that's deeply influenced by Java, 
designed by people who are unapologetic fans of Java.


### Why a new language?

Well, we've been designing and building frameworks and 
libraries for Java for ten years, and we know its limitations 
intimately. And we're frustrated. The number one technical 
problem that we simply can't solve to our satisfaction in 
Java - or in any other existing JVM language - is the problem 
of defining user interfaces and structured data using a 
typesafe, hierarchical syntax. Without a solution to this 
problem, Java remains joined at the hip to XML.

But much of our frustration is not even with the Java 
language itself. The extremely outdated class libraries that 
form the Java SE SDK are riddled with problems. Developing a 
great SDK is a top priority of the project.
