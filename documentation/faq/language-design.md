# FAQ on language design

#{page.table_of_contents}

You probably want to take the [Tour](/documentation/tour) before reading this, 
or the questions might not make sense.

Designing a language is about trade offs. Some features are sacrificed to make 
room for others and some syntax ideas are abandoned to better fit the 
language goals.

### Goals

The goals behind the design of Ceylon are multiple, here are the most 
important ones:

* Offering a typesafe hierarchical syntax for structured data - especially UIs
* Reusing the good of Java
* Being easy to read, even for beginners

## Syntax

### String interpolation syntax

Why not `"Hello $name"` or `"Hello ${name.uppercase}"` instead of `"Hello" name ""`?

In a word because it works much better for designing UIs.

We originally looked into the `${}` syntax, but it turns out that this can't
be lexed using a regular expression. Groovy, for example, uses a
complex hand-coded lexer to handle this stuff. From a pure
language-designer perspective, that's a real red flag. 
The syntax that we ended up settling on isn't as great for everyday procedural
code, but it *is* much nicer for defining UIs using the declarative
syntax (which are a primary goals for the language).

### Semi-colons ';' at the end of line?

It's a choice between that or the ugly `@annotation` syntax. You
need one or the other, or your language can't be parsed. Languages
which ditch the semi colon *have* to introduce a special punctuation for
annotations, and that means that they also have to keywordize common
modifiers like `public`, `virtual`, etc, since they just can't
stomach the ugly syntax for their own annotations (they can't contemplate
`@public` or `@virtual`).

It's the lesser of two evils, really.

### Colon ':' vs 'extends' in class definition

It's partially a matter of taste.
But the real reason for this
is that if you use `:` for `extends`, you then need to come up with
punctuation that means `satisfies`, `abstracts`, `of`, `adapts`, etc, and
you wind up in a rabbit hole of `:>`, `<:`, `%>`, etc, etc.

In general, Ceylon favours being more explicit at the cost of being little more
verbose, so we prefer keywords and annotations to cryptic punctuation.

### 'implements' vs 'satisfies'

We use `satisfies` so that type constraints can use a syntax
that is regular with class and interface declarations. `extends`
or `implements` would simply not work for an upper bound type
constraint.

### Immutability

> The distinctions between immutable and mutable, the `variable` annotation, 
and = and := look like a lot of rules to remember.

The rules are:

* If you want to be able to assign a value to something more than once, you need 
  to annotate it `variable`. It's the precise opposite of Java where you need to 
  annotate something `final` if you don't want to be able to assign to it.
* To assign to a `variable`, you use `:=`. Otherwise, you use `=`.

Like in ML, this is to warn you that the code is doing something side-effecty.

## Visibility model

### no 'protected' keyword?

In our view, there is zero software-engineering justification for
`protected`. A dependency is a dependency. Whether its coming from
a subtype or not is irrelevant.

It's worth noting that Ceylon supports modular programming allowing control 
over the visibilty of classes, methods and attributes between packages and 
modules.

### 'override' vs 'actual'

`override` is a verb, and doesn't read well when combined with other
annotations. Annotations read best together when they are all
adjectives.

## Constructs

### Introductions

Introductions are a compromise between two features you'll find in 
other languages. Extension methods (best known from C#) and implicit 
type conversions (featured in several languages including C++ and Scala).

Extension methods are a safe, convenient feature that let you add new 
members to a pre-existing type. Unfortunately, they don't give you the 
ability to introduce a new supertype to the type.

Implicit type conversions are a dangerous feature that screw up several 
useful properties of the type system (including transitivity of 
assignability), introducing complexity into mechanisms like member 
resolution and type argument inference, and can easily be abused.

Introduction is a disciplined way to introduce a new supertype to an 
existing type, using a mechanism akin to extension methods, without the 
downsides of implicit type conversions.

### Union types

TODO complete this

The use of union types actually turns out to nicely resolve
some of the problems with a Haskell/ML/Scala `Option`/`Maybe` types.
The union types are much more transparent, since you never need
to instantiate an `Option`.

They also work nicely for type (arg) inference. 
One of the problems in Java generics is that the compiler often
infers types that are "non-denotable", i.e. not representable within
the Java language. This results in *really* confusing error messages.
That *never* happens in Ceylon, since union types are denotable and
the compiler never needs to infer any kind of existential type.
