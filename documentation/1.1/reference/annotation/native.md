# #{page.title_md}

The `native` annotation marks a declaration that is not implemented 
in the Ceylon programming language.

## Usage

<!-- try: -->
     native class Example() {
     }

## Description

Currently Ceylon does not offer a well defined "native interface", 
and therefore this annotation is intended to be used only by the 
language module and dedicated interoperability modules. In a future
version of the language, this annotation will be available for
general use.
