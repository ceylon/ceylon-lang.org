# #{page.title_md}

The `variable` annotation marks a reference that may be 
[assigned](../../operator/assign) more than once.

## Usage

<!-- try: -->
    void example() {
        variable Integer i;
        i = 1;
        i = 2;
    }

## Description

By default, references are _immutable_. They are assigned
a value once, and may not be reassigned. The Ceylon compiler
statically verifies that a reference not declared `variable` 
is never assigned more than once. The `variable` annotation
disables this verification, allowing a reference to be
assigned multiple times.
