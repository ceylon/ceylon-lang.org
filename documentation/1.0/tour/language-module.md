# #{page.title}

This is the thirteenth part of the Tour of Ceylon. The [previous part](../comprehensions)
introduced comprehensions . We're now going to learn about Ceylon's 
_language module_ and some of the basic types it defines.

The language module is special, because it is referred to by the language
specification, and some language-level constructs are defined in terms of
the types it declares. Therefore, you can think of it as forming part of 
the language definition. 

## An overview of the language module

The module [`ceylon.language`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/) 
contains classes and interfaces that are referred to in the language 
specification, other declarations *they* refer to, and a number of related 
useful functions and types. Let's meet the main characters.

Just like Java, Ceylon has a class named 
[`Object`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Object.html).

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    doc "The abstract supertype of all types representing 
         definite values."
    see (IdentifiableObject)
    shared abstract class Object() 
            extends Void() {
        
        doc "Determine if two values are equal..."
        shared formal Boolean equals(Object that);
        
        doc "The hash value of the value..."
        shared formal Integer hash;
        
        doc "A developer-friendly string representing the 
             instance..."
        shared default String string {
            return className(this) + "@" + hash.string;
        }
        
    }

In Ceylon, `Object` *isn't* the root of the type system. An expression of 
type `Object` has a definite, well-defined, non-`null` value. 
As we've seen, the Ceylon type system can also represent some more exotic 
types, for example 
[`Nothing`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Nothing.html), 
which is the type of `null`.

Therefore, Ceylon's `Object` has a superclass, named 
[`Void`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Void.html).

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    doc "The abstract supertype of all types. A value of type 
         `Void` may be a definite value of type `Object`, or it 
         may be the `null` value. A method declared `void` is 
         considered to have the return type `Void`..."
    shared abstract class Void() 
            of Object | Nothing {}

All Ceylon types are assignable to `Void`. Expressions of type `Void` aren't 
useful for very much, since `Void` has no members or operations. The one 
useful thing you can do with `Void` is represent the signature of a method 
when you don't care about the return type, nor if it even has one, since a 
method declared `void` is considered to have return type `Void`, as we saw 
in the [part about functions](../functions).

<!--I guess this information is useful but definitely doesn't belong in this chapter:
A method declared `void` is considered to have return type `Void`, as we saw in the 
[part about functions](../functions), and implicitly returns `null`. On the 
other hand a method declared `Void` can return anything at all, but the caller 
will have to narrow the return value it to something more specific to do 
anything with it. In practice there's no point declaring a method `Void` 
because if it returns something useful to the caller *any* other type is 
more useful, and if it doesn't return something useful it should be declared 
`void`. The only other difference between the two is that a `void` method is 
allowed to use a plain `return` statement, or return implicitly, whereas any 
other return type requires an explicit `return` with an expression.
-->

The class `Nothing` also directly extends `Void`. 

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    doc "The type of the `null` value. Any union type of form 
         `Nothing|T` is considered an optional type, whose values
         include `null`. Any type of this form may be written as
         `T?` for convenience."
    see (null)
    shared abstract class Nothing() 
            of null
            extends Void() {}

The object `null` is the only instance of this class.

All types that represent well-defined values extend `Object`, including:

* user-written classes,
* all interfaces, and
* the types that are considered primitive in Java, such as 
  [`Boolean`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Boolean.html),
  [`Integer`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Integer.html),
  [`Float`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Float.html) and 
  [`Character`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Character.html).

Since an expression of type `Object` always evaluates to a definite, 
well-defined value, it's possible to obtain the runtime type of an 
`Object`, or narrow an expression of type `Object` to a more specific 
type.


## Equality and identity

On the other hand, since `Object` is a supertype of types like `Float` 
which are passed by value at the level of the Java Virtual Machine, you 
can't use the `===` operator to test the identity of two values of type 
`Object`. Instead, `===` is defined to act opon instances of the interface 
[`Identifiable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Identifiable.html)

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    doc "The abstract supertype of all types with a well-defined
         notion of identity. Values of type `Identifiable` may 
         be compared to determine if they are references to the 
         same object instance."
    shared interface Identifiable {
        
        doc "Identity equality comparing the identity of the two 
             values..."
        shared default actual Boolean equals(Object that) {
            if (is Identifiable that) {
                return this===that;
            }
            else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        doc "The system-defined identity hash value of the 
             instance..."
        see (identityHash)
        shared default actual Integer hash {
            return identityHash(this);
        }
        
    }

`Identifiable` implements the `hash` attribute and `equals()` method of
`Object`, which are very similar to the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods 
defined by `java.lang.Object`.

Just like in Java, you can refine this default implementation in your own 
classes. This is the normal way to get a customized behavior for the `==` 
operator, the only constraint being, that for subtypes of `Identifiable`, 
`x===y` should imply `x==y`â€” equality should be consistent with identity.

By default, a user-written class extends the class 
[`IdentifiableObject`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_IdentifiableObject.html), 
which extends `Object` and satisfies `Identifiable`. It's possible for a 
user-written class to directly extend `Object`, but most of the classes 
you write will be subclasses of `IdentifiableObject`. All classes with 
`variable` attributes must extend `IdentifiableObject`.

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    doc "The default superclass when no superclass is explicitly
         specified using `extends`."
    shared abstract class IdentifiableObject() 
            extends Object() satisfies Identifiable {}


## Operator polymorphism

Ceylon discourages the creation of intriguing executable ASCII art. 
Therefore, true operator overloading is *not* supported by the language. 
Instead, almost every operator (every one except the primitive `.`, `()`, 
`is`, and `:=` operators) is considered a shortcut way of writing some more 
complex expression involving other operators and ordinary method calls. 
For example, the `<` operator is defined in terms of the interface 
[`Comparable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Comparable.html), 
which has a method named `compare()`. The operator expression

<!-- check:none -->
    x<y

means, by definition,

<!-- check:none -->
    x.compare(y) === smaller

The equality operator `==` is defined in terms of the class `Object`, 
which has a method named `equals()`. So

<!-- check:none -->
    x==y

means, by definition,

<!-- check:none -->
    x.equals(y)

Therefore, it's easy to customize operators like `<` and `==` with specific 
behavior for our own classes, just by implementing or refining methods 
like `compare()` and `equals()`. Thus, we say that operators are polymorphic 
in Ceylon.

Apart from `Comparable` and `Object`, which provide the underlying 
definition of comparison and equality operators, the following interfaces are 
also important in the definition of Ceylon's polymorphic operators:

* [`Summable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Summable.html) 
  supports the infix `+` operator,
* [`Invertable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Invertable.html) 
  supports the prefix `+` and `-` operators,
* [`Ordinal`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Ordinal.html) 
  supports the unary `++` and `--` operators,
* [`Numeric`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Numeric.html) 
  supports the other basic arithmetic operators,
* [`Comparable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Comparable.html) 
  supports the comparison operators,
* [`Correspondence`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Correspondence.html) 
  supports the index operator, 
* [`Boolean`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Boolean.html)
  is the basis of the logical operators, and
* [`Set`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Set.html) 
  is the basis of the set operators.


## Characters and character strings

We've already met the class `String`, way back in 
[the first leg of the tour](../basics/#string_literals). Ceylon strings are composed of 
[`Character`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Character.html)s&mdash;indeed, 
a `String` is a [`List`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_List.html)
of `Character`s.

A character literal is written between backticks. (Not single quotes!)

    Character[] latinLetters = join(`a`..`z`, `A`..`Z`);
    Character newline = `\n`;
    Character pi = `\{0001D452}`;

An instance of `Character` represents a 32-bit Unicode character, not a
Java-style UTF-16 `char`. However, under the covers, Ceylon strings are
implemented using a Java `char[]` array (in fact, they are implemented
using a Java string). So some operations on Ceylon strings are much
slower than you might expect, since they must take four-byte characters
into account. This includes `size` and `item()`. We think it's much better
that these operations be slow, like in Ceylon, than that they sometimes
give the wrong answer, like in Java. And
[remember](../sequences/#sequence_gotchas_for_java_developers), it's 
never correct to iterate a list using `size` and `item()` in Ceylon!

To avoid the cost of calling `size()`, try to use the more efficient
`empty`, `longerThan()` and `shorterThan()` when the string might be 
very long.

## Numeric types

As we've mentioned several times before, Ceylon doesn't have anything like 
Java's primitive types. The types that represent numeric values are just 
ordinary classes. Ceylon has fewer built-in numeric types than other C-like 
languages:

* [`Integer`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Integer.html) 
  represents signed integers, and
* [`Float`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Float.html) 
  represents floating point approximations to the real numbers.

The number of bits or precision on these types depends on whether
you're compiling Ceylon code for Java or for JavaScript. When compiling for 
Java they have 64-bit precision by default. Eventually, you'll 
be able to specify that a value has 32-bit precision by annotating it 
`small`. But note that this annotation is really just a hint that the compiler 
is free to ignore (and it currently does).

## Numeric literals

In their simplest form the literals for `Integer`s, and 
literals for `Float`s look as you might expect from other languages:

    Integer one = 1;
    Float oneHundredth = 0.01;
    Float oneMillion = 1.0E+6;

However they can be a bit more sophisticated. The digits of a numeric literal 
may be grouped using underscores. If the 
digits are grouped, then groups must contain exactly three digits.

    Integer twoMillionAndOne = 2_000_001;
    Float pi = 3.141_592_654;

A very large or small numeric literals may be qualified by one of the standard 
SI unit prefixes: `m`, `u`, `n`, `p`, `f`, `k`, `M`, `G`, `T`, `P`.

    Float red = 390.0n; // n (nano) means E-9
    Float galaxyDiameter = 900.0P; // P (peta) means E+15
    Float hydrogenRadius = 25.0p; // p (pico) means E-12
    Float usGovDebt = 14.33T; // T (tera) means E+12
    Float brainCellSize = 4.0u; // u (micro) means E-6
    Integer deathsUnderCommunism = 94M; // M (mega) means E+6

## `Whole` and `Decimal`

The platform module `ceylon.math` defines the types `Whole` and `Decimal`,
which represent arbitrary precision integers and arbitrary precision decimals.
Both classes are subtypes of `Numeric`, so you can use all the usual numeric
operators with them:

    Decimal num = ... ;
    Decimal denom = ... ;
    Decimal ratio = num/denom;

## Abstracting over numeric types

Since all numeric types are subtypes of `Numeric`, it's possible to write
generic code that treats numeric values polymorphically.

    Value ratio<Value>(Value num, Value denom) 
            given Value satisfies Numeric<Value> {
        return num/denom;
    }

You can pass `Float`s, `Integer`s, `Whole`s, `Decimal`s or any other numeric
type to `ratio()`. But since polymorphic numeric functions can't be optimized
to use VM-level primitive types, this function is likely to be much slower
than a function that accepts two `Float`s or two `Integer`s.

## Numeric widening

As mentioned earlier, Ceylon doesn't have implicit type conversions, 
not even built-in conversions for numeric types. Assignment does not 
automatically widen (or narrow) numeric values. Instead, we need to call 
one of the operations (well, attributes, actually) defined by the interface 
[`Number`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Number.html).

    Float zero = 0.float; // explicitly widen from Integer

You can use all the operators you're used to from other C-style languages 
with the numeric types. You can also use the `**` operator to raise a 
number to a power:

<!-- cat: void m(Float length, Float width) { -->
    Float diagonal = (length**2.0+width**2.0)**0.5;
<!-- cat: } -->

Of course, if you want to use the increment `++` operator, decrement `--` 
operator, or one of the compound assignment operators such as `+=`, you'll 
have to declare the value `variable`.

Since it's quite noisy to explicitly perform numeric widening in numeric 
expressions, the numeric operators automatically widen their operands, 
so we could write the expression above like this:

<!-- cat: void m(Float length, Float width) { -->
    Float diagonal = (length**2+width**2)**(1.0/2);
<!-- cat: } -->

Because `ceylon.language` only has two numeric types the only "built-in" 
widening conversion is from `Integer` to `Float`. But this 
conversion isn't defined by special-case rules in the 
language specification.


## Numeric operator semantics

Operators in Ceylon are, in principle, just abbreviations for some 
expression involving a method call. So the numeric types all implement the 
`Numeric` interface, refining the methods `plus()`, `minus()`, `times()`, 
`divided()` and `power()`, and the `Invertable` interface, refining 
`negativeValue` and `positiveValue`. The numeric operators are defined in 
terms of these methods of `Numeric`. The numeric types also implement the 
interface [`Castable`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Castable.html), 
which enables the widening conversions we just mentioned.

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    shared interface Castable<in Types> {
        shared formal CastValue castTo<CastValue>()
            given CastValue satisfies Types;
    }

The type parameter `Types` uses a special trick. The argument to `Types` 
should be the union of all types to which the implementing type is castable.

For example, simplifying slightly the definitions in the language module:

<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    shared abstract class Integer()
            extends Object()
            satisfies Castable<Integer|Float> &
                      Integral<Integer> &
                      Numeric<Integer> {
        ...
    }
    
<!-- check:none:decl from ceylon.language -->
    shared abstract class Float()
            extends Object()
            satisfies Castable<Float> &
                      Numeric<Float> {
        ...
    }

These declarations tell us that `Integer` can be widened to `Float`, but 
that `Float` cannot be widened to anything. So we can infer that the 
expression `-1 * 0.4` is of type `Float`.

Therefore, the definition of a numeric operator like `*` can be represented, 
completely within the type system, in terms of `Numeric` and `Castable`:

<!-- check:none:pedagogical -->
    Result product<Left,Right,Result>(Left x, Right y)
            given Result of Left|Right satisfies Numeric<Result>
            given Left satisfies Castable<Result> & Numeric<Left>
            given Right satisfies Castable<Result> & Numeric<Right> {
        return x.castTo<Result>().times(y.castTo<Result>());
    }

Don't worry too much about the performance implications of all this â€” 
in practice, the compiler is permitted to optimize the types `Integer`, 
`Integer`, and `Float` down to the virtual machine's native numeric types.

The value of all this â€” apart from eliminating special cases in the 
language definition and type checker â€” is that a library can define its 
own specialized numeric types, without losing any of the nice language-level 
syntax support for numeric arithmetic and numeric widening conversions.

### implementation note <!-- m3 -->

Numeric widening for custom numeric types is not supported in Ceylon M3, and
so implementing `Castable` has no effect.

## Collections

The language module includes several interfaces that represent container
types: 
[`Collection`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Castable.html),
[`List`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Castable.html),
[`Map`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Castable.html), and
[`Set`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/interface_Castable.html).

You might be disappointed to discover that there are no general-purpose 
implementations of these interfaces in the language module itself. In fact,
they're only declared here so that `String`, `Sequence`, and 
[`Array`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/class_Array.html) 
can be subtypes of `List`.

You might be even more disappointed when you look at these interfaces and
discover that they're missing half the useful operations you're used to 
seeing on a collection: they have no operations at all for building or
mutating the collection. Actually, there's a couple of good reasons for this:

- It's usually best for an API to return an obviously read-only collection
  to clients, instead of leaving the client scratching his head wondering
  whether mutating this collection results in mutation of the internal data 
  structures held by the API, and whether this is safe.
- Making these interfaces read-only means they can be declared 
  [covariant](../generics/#covariance_and_contravariance) in their type 
  parameters.  

The module `ceylon.collection` contains general-purpose implementations of
these interfaces, along with APIs for building and mutating collectons.

### implementation note <!-- m3 -->

The module `ceylon.collection` does not yet exist, as of the release of 
Ceylon M3!

## There's more...

The language module isn't by itself a platform for building applications.
It's a minimal set of basic types that form part of the language definition
itself. The Ceylon SDK is still under development, but you can already
start using [ceylon.file](http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/modules/ceylon.file),
[ceylon.process](http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/modules/ceylon.process), and
[ceylon.math](http://modules.ceylon-lang.org/modules/ceylon.math). 

Next we're going to come back to the subject of [object initialization](../initialization), 
and deal with a subtle problem affecting languages like Java and C#.
