## Usage 

Types are explicit in Ceylon source code at every declaration that is not
[inferred](#type_inference).

## Description

Ceylon is a *statically typed* language. This means that the type of 
every expression is known at compile time and the compiler uses this 
information to prevent typing errors.

Moreover the type system is based on 
*principal types*, which means every expression has a unique, *most specific* 
type.

### Type declarations

In Ceylon, a *type declaration* is one of:

* A [`class` declaration](../class)
* An [`object` declaration](../object)
* An [`interface` declaration](../interface)

#### Local declarations

A *local* (or *nested*) declaration is a declaration that is 
contained within another declaration or a statement.

#### Top-level declarations

A *top level* declaration is contained directly in a
[compilation units](../compilation_unit) and not contained within any other
declaration. In other words a top level declaration is not 
a [local](#local_declarations) declaration.

### Union types

Given type expressions `X` and `Y`, Ceylon lets you express the union of 
instances of those types using the notation `X|Y`. For example:

<!-- cat: void m() { -->
    variable String|Integer x:= "";
    x:= 0;
<!-- cat: } -->

### Intersection types

Given type expressions `X` and `Y`, Ceylon lets you express the 
intersection of instances of those types using the notation `X&Y`.

### Enumerated types

Classes can [enumerate](../class#enumerated_classes) 
a list of their permitted subclasses. 

Interfaces can [enumerate](../interface#enumerated_subtypes) 
a list of their permitted subtypes. 

### Type aliases

You can define an alias for a type using the `alias` keyword:

    alias BasicType = String|Character|Integer|Float|Boolean;
    
It is also possible to define [class aliases](../class#aliases)
 and [interface aliases](../interface#aliases) 
 using an assignment, for example:

    interface Strings = Collection<String>;

    
### `Nothing`

`Nothing` is the type of `null`. If an expression permits `null` then it
needs `Nothing` as a supertype. This is usually expressed as using a 
[union type](#union_types) such as `T|Nothing`, which can be abbreviated 
as `T?`.

### `Bottom`

`Bottom` is the intersection of *all* types. It is equivalent to the empty set.
Because `Bottom` is the intersection of all types it is assignable to 
all types. Similarly because it is the intersection of all types it can have 
no instances.

### `Empty`

`Empty` is the type of the 
[expression `{}`](../../expression/sequence-instantiation). 

### `Sequence`

`Sequence` is the type of non-empty 
[sequences](../../expression/sequence-instantiation). Because we often want 
to treat empty and non-empty sequences in a common way the 
[union type](#union_types) `Sequence<T>|Empty` can be abbreviated to `T[]`.

### Type inference

Local declarations don't need to explictly declare a type, they can let the 
compiler infer the type from the expression. Because the type system is based 
on *principal types* there is only one type the compiler can infer.
