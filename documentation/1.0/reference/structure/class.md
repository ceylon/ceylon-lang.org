# #{page.title}

A class is a stateful type that can be 
[instantiated](../../expression/class-instantiation).

## Usage 

A trivial class declaration looks like this:

<!-- id:c -->
    class C() {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }


## Description

### Initializer

The class *initializer* executes when instances of the class are created
(also known as [*class instantiation*](../../expression/class-instantiation)). 
The parameters to the initializer are specified in parenthesis after the 
name of the class in the `class` declaration.

### Extending classes

A class `S` is declared as a subclass of another class `C` using the `extends` 
keyword like this:

<!-- cat-id:c -->
    class S() extends C() {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }

If a class is declared without using the `extends` keywords it is a subclass of
[`IdentifiableObject`](#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/class_IdentifiableObject.html).

Note that the arguments to the superclasses [initializer](#initializer) are 
specified in parenthesis after the name of the superclass in the `extends` 
clause. 

### Satisfying interfaces

A class can satisfy zero or more [interfaces](../interface) using the 
`satisfies` keyword. If the class `C` is to satisfy interfaces `I1` and `I2` the 
declaration looks like this:

<!-- cat: interface I1 {} interface I2 {} -->
    class C() satisfies I1 & I2 {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }

`&` is used as the separator between satisfied interfaces because `C` is 
satisfying a type, the 
[intersection type](../type#intersection_types) `I1&I2`.

### Enumerated classes

The subclasses of an `abstract` class can be constrained to a list of named 
classes or toplevel anonymous classes using the `of` clause. 
If the class `C` is permitted only two direct 
subclasses `S1` and `S2` its declaration would look like this:

    abstract class C() of S1 | S2 {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }
<!-- cat: class S1() extends C() {} -->
<!-- cat: class S2() extends C() {} -->

### Type parameters

A class declaration lists [type parameters](../type-parameters) with angle brackets (`<` and `>`) 
after the class name. 

    class C<Z>() {
        /* declarations of class members 
           type parameter Z treated as a type */
    }

A class declaration with type parameters may have a `given` clause for each declared type parameter 
to [constraint the permitted type argument](../type-parameters#constraints).

### Parameter list

A class declaration requires a [parameter list](../parameter-list)

### Concrete classes

A class that can be [instantiated](../../expression/class-instantiation) is 
*concrete*. It follows that `abstract` or `formal` classes are not concrete.

### Abstract classes

A class declaration may be annotated `abstract`, like this:

    abstract class C() {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }

Abstract classes cannot be [instantiated](../../expression/class-instantiation).

Abstract classes may have `formal` members. 

### Shared classes

A class declaration may be annotated `shared`,like this:

    shared class C() {
        /* declarations of class members */
    }

A top-level `shared` class is visible wherever the package that contains it is 
visible.

A member `shared` class is visible wherever the class or interface that 
contains it is visible.

### Formal classes

Toplevel classes may not be annotated `formal`.

Formal classes cannot be [instantiated](../../expression/class-instantiation).

A `formal` class may have `formal` members.

A block local class may not be annotated `formal`.

A `formal` inner class may be subject to 
[member class refinement](#member_class_refinement). 

### Default classes

A class may be annotated `default` if it is contained in a concrete `shared` 
class or interface. 

A block local class may not be annotated `formal`.

A `default` inner class may be subject to 
[member class refinement](#member_class_refinement). 

### Members

The permitted members of classes are [classes](../class), 
[interfaces](../interface), 
[methods](../method), 
[attributes](../attribute)
and [`object`s](../object).

### Aliases

A *class alias* is a kind of [type alias](../type-alias) that declares a 
class in terms of a type expression:

<!-- cat: class B() {} -->
    class C() => B();


### Member class refinement

An inner class of a class or interface can be subject to 
*member class refinement*, which means its instantiation will be 
polymorphic. 

Here's an example where a `Reader` class declares that concrete 
subclasses *must* (because we used `formal`) provide an `actual Buffer` 
inner class.

    shared abstract class Reader() {
        shared formal class Buffer(Character* chars)
                satisfies Sequence<Character> {}
        // ...
    }

    shared class FileReader(File file) 
            extends Reader() {
        shared actual class Buffer(Character* chars)
                extends Reader::Buffer(chars) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
    
Within `Reader` (and elsewhere) we can instantiate the relevant kind of 
`Buffer` with a normal instantiation, `Buffer(chars)`. This allows each 
subclass of `Reader` to implement an appropriate kind of `Buffer`.

Member class refinement is a lot like the 'abstract factory' pattern in
other object-oriented languages, but it's a lot less verbose.

Only `formal` and `default` member classes are subject to member class 
refinement. A `formal` member class *must* be refined by concrete subtypes 
of the type declaring the member class&mdash;just like a `formal` method or 
attribute. A `default` member class *may* be refined&mdash;just like
a `default` method or attribute.

In a subtype of the type declaring the member class the member class 
(i.e. in `FileReader.Buffer` from the example above) must:

* be declared `actual`,
* have the same name as the member class in the declaring type (`Buffer` in 
  the example),
* have a parameter list with a compatible signature and,
* extend the member class (you'll need to use 
  [`super`](../../expression/super) or [`::`](../../expression/supertype-access) 
  in the `extends` clause).

Refined member types are similar to, but not the same as virtual types, which 
Ceylon does not support.
