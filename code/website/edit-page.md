# Edit a page (tips and tricks)

#{page.table_of_contents}

Pages are primarily written in Markdown. More complex ones may be written in haml. 
Markdown has a very simple and human readable syntax which is described 
[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

You can find two sample files for [.md](/code/website/md-sample) and 
[.html.haml](/code/website/haml-sample) syntaxes. Look at them especially the .md file.

There are a few additional tricks and recommendations for you.

### Links between site pages

Files named `index.md` will generate an `index.html` file in the same directory.
However, any other file name will generate a new directory named after the file.
This directory will contain an `index.html` file. The reason for this behavior
is to have more elegent URLs. For example, `/code/website/edit.md` will generate
`/code/website/edit/index.html`.

For that reason, use URLs without the `/index.html` suffix. Likewise, using URLs based
off root is safer in case the page is moved around.

<!-- lang: none -->
    [link to edit](/code/website/edit)

### Syntax highlighting

Blocks of code in Markdown are indented with 4 spaces. By default, highlighting is done
for the Ceylon syntax. You can change the targeted language by adding some specific HTML comment
right before the block of code. You can use:

- Java: &lt;!-- lang: java --&gt;
- Bash: &lt;!-- lang: bash --&gt;
- XML: &lt;!-- lang: xml --&gt;
- no highlighting: &lt;!-- lang: none --&gt;

In Bash

<!-- lang: bash -->
    <!-- lang: bash -->
        #!/bin/bash
        if [ ! -d "$HOME/.ceylon" ]; then
            echo "Ceylon rocks"
        fi

In Java 

<!-- lang: java -->
    <!-- lang: java -->
        public final class Address {
        	public String getStreet() { return street;}
        	public void setStreet(String street) { this.street = street;}
        	private String street;
        }

And in Ceylon

        shared Address(String street) {
        	shared variable street = street;
        }

### Adding an automatic table of content

You can automatically generate the table of content based on the page
metadata:

- Add `toc: true` in the file header
- add `\#{page.table_of_contents}` where you want the table to appear

You should see a table of content similar to the top of this page.

### Documentation section

The documentation is all under a version umbrella (ie `/documentation/1.0`). The purpose is to
be able to keek old documentations and have stable URLs. The latest and stable documentation is 
available at `/documentation/current` which is a redirect to a specific version. Note that you can 
point to subsections eg `/documentation/current/ide`. Use the `current` URL for links that are
generic and from other sections of the website. Be careful that over time the documentation structure
will evolve from versions to versions: the more specific your link is, the more fragile it is.

If you are describing specific features introduced in specific versions, for example in a blog,
it is probably better to use the URL containing the explicit version eg `/documentation/1.0/ide`.

Links from within the documentation section must all be relative. To facilitate navigation, you should:

- Add `doc_root: ../..` in the file header where `../..` is the relative URL pointing to root
  Remember that asides from `index.md` files, all files are generated in a directory which adds
  on level to point to root. For example `/documentation/1.0/introduction.md` creates 
  `/documentation/1.0/introduction/index.html` and its relative URL to root is `..`
- Use it in your file to build the relative URL eg `\#{page.doc_root}/ide`

#### Referencing the specification or the ceylondoc

If you want to point to the spec from within the documentation section, use relative links

    [specification](\#{page.doc_root}/spec)

You can point to a specific section of the spec this way

    [logical operators](\#{page.doc_root}/\#{site.urls.spec_relative}#logical)

If you want to point to the current spec, use

    [specification](/documentation/current/spec)

You can point to a specific section of the spec this way

    [tools](\#{site.urls.spec_current}#tools)

_Note to specification writers, specification anchors should be stable._

Likewise, to point to a ceylondoc entry, use the variable `site.urls.apidoc_current`.

<!-- lang: none -->
    [Doc for `Comparable`]
    (\#{site.urls.apidoc_current}/ceylon/language/Comparable.html)

Or from within the documentation section,

<!-- lang: none -->
    [Doc for `Comparable`]
    (\#{page.doc_root}/api/ceylon/language/Comparable.html)

By using these placeholders, we will be able to move the spec or ceylondoc to other places.

Never point to `/documentation/_version_/api` as there are no landing page.

### Linking withing a page

Markdown by itself doesn't allow the author to put `id` attributes or anchors
(`<a name="...">`) in the generated HTML, which is annoying if you want to link 
to a particular part of the page. You can of course put `<a name="...">` 
elements in yourself, but:

* It clutters up the nice markdown with HTML.
* It forces you to ensure the uniqueness of the ids you use.
* It's tedious.

We generate id attributes automatically for all 
`<h*>` and `<p>` elements. For headings we use the heading text (suitably 
munged into an XML NAME). For paragraphs we use the first few words (again 
suitable normalized, and also worrying about uniqueness). If an element 
already has an `id` then it's untouched. If there's a matching `id` 
(or `name`, since they share the same namespace), steps are taken to 
disambiguate the generated one.

The long and the short of this is that we can now easily and accurately link 
into the middle of documents. The *caveat* is that you should be aware that 
changing the first few words of a paragraph (or the text of a heading) is 
likely to break any links which point to it. To prevent such broken links 
you can always use an explicit `<a name="">` at the relevant point.
